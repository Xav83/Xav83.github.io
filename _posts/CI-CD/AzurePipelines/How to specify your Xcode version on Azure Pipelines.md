# How to specify your Xcode version on Azure Pipelines

Hello ! I'm Xavier Jouvenot and in this small post, I am going to explain how to specify your Xcode version on Azure Pipelines.

_Self promotion_: You can find other articles on computer science and programming on my [website](www.10xlearner.com) ðŸ˜‰

## Problematic

If you have CI/CD processes or if you want to create some for your project, then it may be wise to make sure that you can always compile your project using the same version of Xcode as the one you are using on your machine, or the one used by your development team.

Another use case where specifying a version of Xcode can be very useful, is to upgrade the version you, and/or your dev team, are actually using.
Indeed, by specifying a newer version of Xcode in your CI/CD configuration, you can make sure everything works with the new version before asking everybody to upgrade the version of Xcode on their machine, and have a smooth transition.

## Solution

The short answer, for the people who don't want to read through the entire article (I know you do that! I do it too ðŸ˜†) is to insert the following setup in your Azure Pipelines process, before trying to compile anything:

```yml
  - script: |
      sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode_<version_number>.app
    displayName: Selects a specific version of Xcode
```

So, for example, if you want to select the version `13.1` of Xcode on Azure Pipelines, then, it would look like that:

```yml
  - script: |
      sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode_13.1.app
    displayName: Selects a specific version of Xcode
```

If you are not sure about the version of Xcode you are actually using on Azure Pipelines, you can always look to the documentation relative to the image you are using ([osx11](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/main/images/macos/macos-11-Readme.md#xcode), [osx10.15](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/main/images/macos/macos-10.15-Readme.md#xcode) or [osx10.14](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/main/images/macos/macos-10.14-Readme.md#xcode)), or you can add the following step to you process and see the information directly in Azure Pipelines:

```yml
  - script: |
      sudo xcode-select -p
    displayName: Displays the current version of Xcode
```

## Diving deeper with concrete examples

To make sure that, even in the future, you have working examples to look at, I have made a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Xav83/tutorials) with an Azure Pipelines process for each version of Xcode present on each OSX virtual environment available.

In the [azure-pipelines.yml file](https://github.com/Xav83/tutorials/blob/main/.azure-pipelines.yml) at the root of the repository, you will see jobs set up for each OSX environment, linked to the template file [azure-pipelines.yml file](https://github.com/Xav83/tutorials/blob/main/Xcode%20version/azure-pipelines.yml) in a dedicated folder which selects each version of XCode available and print it once it has been selected.

I will maintain those Azure pipelines processes when Microsoft will update their environment images, so that we will always be able to use this repository as reference! So if you see a version of Xcode or an version of OSX missing, do not hesitate to create a new issue ðŸ˜‰
