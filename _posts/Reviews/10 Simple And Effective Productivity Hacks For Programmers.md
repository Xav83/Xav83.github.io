# Book review - 10 Simple And Effective Productivity Hacks For Programmers, by Simple Programmer

Hello ! I'm Xavier Jouvenot and today, I want to talk to you about a document I've just read.
This document is named *"10 Simple And Effective Productivity Hacks For Programmers"*, by Simple Programmer.

This is a very small book composed of 14 pages (so really quick to read) detailing, as the title suggests, 10 ways you can improve your productivity, as a programmer. I won't go over the ‚Äúhacks‚Äù detailed in it, as this is a free digital book that you can get directly on [Simple Programmer website](https://simpleprogrammer.com/10hacks/).

I found this small book really practical, as the different hacks in it are really actionable. Some may require a little bit of time for us to get used to, but everyone can apply them, and will, without a doubt, get great results.
If you are used to reading articles or books on self development, or productivity in general, you will probably know about all these techniques. But, even if this is the case, I encourage you to read it, as it is always nice to refresh those knowledge, and the small format make it easy for a quick read üòÑ

Personally, I know that, when I am in a rush or just too deep in my work, I tend to try to brute force everything rather than using the right method to accomplish everything in a sane and productive manner. So I will go back to this book several times during the following months in order to check up on how I am doing and how I can improve myself. And, since a part of the 1st hack is to clean his deck, I will work in a less messy environment üòÜ

On this note, I am going to clean my desk, and I will let you with this [link](https://simpleprogrammer.com/10hacks/) to the book. üòâ

Thank you all for reading this small article,
And until my next article, have a productive day üôÇ
