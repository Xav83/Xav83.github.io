# CNC 2021 - Write More Challenge

Hi everyone ! I am Xavier Jouvenot, and with this article, I am starting a little series of blog posts to motivate me and reflect on myself as I will progress on the new [CodeNewbie Challenge](https://community.codenewbie.org/cnc2021) "Write More". 🙂

If you are interested in this kind of challenge, a little earlier this year, CodeNewbie has actually released 4 different tracks, during 5 weeks each:
- [Start Coding](https://community.codenewbie.org/cnc2021#start-coding)
- [Code More](https://community.codenewbie.org/cnc2021#code-more)
- [Write More](https://community.codenewbie.org/cnc2021#write-more)
- [Get a Job](https://community.codenewbie.org/cnc2021#get-a-job)

Anyone can select one of this objective and go on a 5 weeks mission to achieve his/her goal, improving its skills, and bonding more with other people.

Personally, I choose the [Write More](https://community.codenewbie.org/cnc2021#write-more) challenge, as I have been blogging on and off for over a year and half, and I would like to improve myself and become more consistent about it.
So this challenge presented itself as an evidence to me, but I may also take another one of this challenge in the future, after completing this one 😉

## The journey already begins

Right after joining the [Write More](https://community.codenewbie.org/cnc2021#write-more) challenge, a "Pre-Mission" have been sent to me, and some homeworks with it 😄

There are a few easy tasks, like being sure to join [CodeNewbie](https://community.codenewbie.org/xav83) and [DEV](https://dev.to/10xlearner) communities, which I obviously did (actually I already had a DEV profile for some time 😝). 

And there is a bigger task, which is to find 3 articles, one for each of the following categories : "tutorial", "explainer" and "project"; and find 3 things I liked about them and 3 things I would do differently.
And just with this assignment I have already learn something ! Most articles fall into one of this category ! 😮
A **tutorial** post would explain how to do a specific task, a **explainer** article would define a concept and the use for it, and finally a **project** blogpost would detail how a project was achieved and the lesson you learned from it.

So I went on [DEV feed](https://dev.to/) (since I did the search before creating my CodeNewbie profile 😝), and read about a bunch of articles before finding the articles I wanted to focus on, for this task. I have actually picked 2 articles by categories, as I didn't know which one to finally choose, and I figured that, by doing so, I would be able to compare them, one to the other to extract the things I liked more in one article compared to the other.

Before putting the links to the article I picked, I want to specify that my objective is not to devalue the time and the efforts that the people who have written those articles have made. All those article are really interesting and I have enjoyed reading them all, and am excited to read their next articles 😉

_Tutorial_:
- [Lint your commits](https://dev.to/dnlnrs/lint-your-commits-2p54)
- [How to Bake A Python Package Cake](https://dev.to/sirfuzzalot/how-to-bake-a-python-package-cake-46l5)

_Explainer_:
- [🚩Pillars Of Computer Science🚩](https://dev.to/kaiwalyakoparkar/pillars-of-computer-science-50ij)
- [💻 Hackathons - All you need to know right now! 💻](https://dev.to/kaiwalyakoparkar/hackathons-all-you-need-to-know-right-now-h6e)

_Project_:
- [My Hackathon Experience](https://dev.to/sagarbarapatre/my-hackathon-experience-3nn4)
- [Lessons from a failed programming test](https://dev.to/legowerewolf/lessons-from-a-failed-programming-test-2d9f)

As for the things I really liked about those articles, and the things I would have done differently, it depends on the article, as each of them treat its subject differently, but here are the things I have picked up during my reading of those articles:
- ❤️ I've liked when the author of the article gives its impression/opinion on the subject
- 🔗 I've also appreciated when there are links to external resources, either to allow the reader to deep down on a subject, or to test/see in action the elements described in the article
- 🖊️ I've enjoyed when the author uses humor, or some style effet to make its article more entertaining
- 🤔 I prefer when the article has a conclusion that wrap up the important points from the article
- 💬 I also like it better when the article is not too factual, as I feel it makes me less connected to it
- 📺 I finally lean more towards the articles that use more than just some words, and also uses images, videos, and put the emphasis on the important points/words of the article.

Finally, to end this first day, we were asked to share out favorite posts in a [dedicated CodeNewbie thread](https://community.codenewbie.org/codenewbie/cnc2021-write-more-pre-mission-submission-thread-k7), which I will be doing right after publishing this article 😉

Thank you all for reading this article,
And until tomorrow for the next assignment, have a splendid day 🙂
